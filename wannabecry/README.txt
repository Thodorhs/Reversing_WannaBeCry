Your computer has been hacked and all your files have been encrypted! But don't worry, your files are safe.
To decrypt them, you need to send 1 million dollars and the key inside the 'KEY.txt' at the following bitcoin addres: BTC_HY455.
After sending the key, you will receive a code to decrypt your files by using the following command:
./wannabecry -d {code}

If you delete the 'KEY.txt' or any other file of this virus, all your files will be lost forever!
